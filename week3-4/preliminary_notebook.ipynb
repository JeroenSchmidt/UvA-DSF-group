    "## Gathering Data - Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "The public Twitter API consists of a REST API and a Streaming API. Most application developers mix and match the APIs to produce their application. The Streaming API provides low-latency high-volume access to Tweets. Additionally, there are some families of APIs (such as the Ads API) which require your application to be whitelisted in order to make use of them. For this assignment we are going to use the [**Twitter Streaming API**](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview).\n",

    "\n",
    "Twitter offers several basic streaming endpoints, each customized to certain use cases:\n",
    "+ **Public Streams** - Streams of the public data flowing through Twitter. Suitable for following specific users or topics, and data mining.\n",
    "+ **User Streams** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Single-user streams, containing roughly all of the data corresponding with a single user’s view of Twitter.\n",
    "+ **Site Streams** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The multi-user version of user streams. Site streams are intended for servers which must connect to Twitter on behalf of many users. Site Streams is a closed beta. Applications are no longer being accepted."

    "**Sentiment Analysis** is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.\n",

    "#### A Basic Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK comes with all the pieces you need to get started on sentiment analysis: a movie reviews corpus with reviews categorized into pos and neg categories, and a number of trainable classifiers. We’ll start with a simple NaiveBayesClassifier as a baseline, using boolean word feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Classifier?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia says: \"<span style='color:red'>An algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier. The term \"classifier\" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.</span>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is basically a computer program that learns how to map a certain input to a certain output. It is able to translate the data in the input space into a different segmented output space, where each datum belongs its own dimension. For our example we are going to use the Naive Bayes classifier. This classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. This makes this classifier simple and easy to use, however in a limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we start doing anything we need a ready corpus of data we can use to demonstrate the concept of Sentiment Analysis."

    "\n",
    "One technique for text mining in Data Science is Topic Modelling. As the name suggests, it is a process to automatically identify topics present in a text object and to derive hidden patterns exhibited by a text corpus. Thus, assisting better decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Modelling is different from rule-based text mining approaches that use regular expressions or dictionary based keyword searching techniques. It is an unsupervised approach used for finding and observing the bunch of words (called “topics”) in large clusters of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics can be defined as “a repeating pattern of co-occurring terms in a corpus”. A good topic model should result in – “health”, “doctor”, “patient”, “hospital” for a topic – Healthcare, and “farm”, “crops”, “wheat” for a topic – “Farming”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Models are very useful for the purpose for document clustering, organizing large blocks of textual data, information retrieval from unstructured text and feature selection. For Example – New York Times are using topic models to boost their user – article recommendation engines. Various professionals are using topic models for recruitment industries where they aim to extract latent features of job descriptions and map them to right candidates. They are being used to organize large datasets of emails, customer reviews, and user social media profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches for obtaining topics from a text such as – Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency. NonNegative Matrix Factorization techniques. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is the most popular topic modeling technique and in this article, we will discuss the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution. Given a dataset of documents, LDA backtracks and tries to figure out what topics would create those documents in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a matrix factorization technique. In vector space, any corpus (collection of documents) can be represented as a document-term matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LDA Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha and Beta Hyperparameters – alpha represents document-topic density and Beta represents topic-word density. Higher the value of alpha, documents are composed of more topics and lower the value of alpha, documents contain fewer topics. On the other hand, higher the beta, topics are composed of a large number of words in the corpus, and with the lower value of beta, they are composed of few words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Topics – Number of topics to be extracted from the corpus. Researchers have developed approaches to obtain an optimal number of topics by using Kullback Leibler Divergence Score. I will not discuss this in detail, as it is too mathematical. For understanding, one can refer to this[1] original paper on the use of KL divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Topic Terms – Number of terms composed in a single topic. It is generally decided according to the requirement. If the problem statement talks about extracting themes or concepts, it is recommended to choose a higher number, if problem statement talks about extracting features or terms, a low number is recommended.\n",
